Hello! my name is Jeon YeEun!
Nice to meet you! 
I live in Jeju Island now.
If you walk in front of my house for 5 minutes, you can see the sea.
Until two weeks ago, there were not many people in Jeju Island because of Corona 19, but recently there have been so many visitors. 
So the cafe in front of my house is always full...ᅲᅲ 
I may not be able to go often because I don't have a seat in the cafe, but you guys don't just stay at home.
Sometimes go out for a change! 
Let's all get over Corona and see each other in good health at school!
